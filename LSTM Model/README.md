# CS301_Project

This project was a part of CS301 final assignment at NJIT

Prof. Pantelis Monogioudis

The purpose of this program is to generate accurate predictions for meal swipes per specified time period based off provided data from GDS backboard systems. In order to accomplish this we utilized various machine learning fundamentals and Long Short Term Memory modeling. The colab notebook utilizes the Keras, SKLearn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy libraries to run.


"Proposal.md" is the proposal for the project.

"LSTM Project Report.pdf" is the report of the results.

In order for the colab notebook to run properly you must download 'GDS_data3.csv' to your local machine and upload the file to the colab notebook.

Project.ipynb is the colab notebook where you can run and test the LSTM model predictions and see various graphs/statistics that verify its accuracy.
