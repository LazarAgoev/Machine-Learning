# CS301_Project

CS301 Section 103 Final Project

Prof. Pantelis Monogioudis

The purpose of this program is to generate accurate predictions for meal swipes per specified time period based off provided data from GDS backboard systems. In order to accomplish this we utilized various machine learning fundamentals and Long Short Term Memory modeling. The colab notebook utilizes the Keras, SKLearn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy libraries to run.

In order for the colab notebook to run properly you must download 'GDS_data3.csv' to your local machine and upload the file to the colab notebook.

GDS Project Presentation (Slides) file is the presentation slides.

CS301_project_presentation.mp4 is the video recording with group members presenting the provided slides.

Project.ipynb is the colab notebook where you can run and test the LSTM model predictions and see various graphs/statistics that verify its accuracy.
